# Consent

## Summary

The `mip::Consent` enum class implements an easy-to-use approach that permits application developers to provide a custom consent experience based on the endpoint that is being accessed by the SDK. The notification can inform a user of the data that will be collected, how to get the data removed, or any other information that is required by law or compliance policies. Once the user grants consent, the application can continue.

## Implementation

Consent is implemented by extending the `mip::Consent` base class and implementing `GetUserConsent` to return one of the `mip::Consent` enum values. 

The object derived from `mip::Consent` is passed in to the `mip::FileProfile::Settings` or `mip::ProtectionProfile::Settings` constructor.

When a user performs an operation that would require providing consent, the SDK calls the `GetUserConsent` method, passing in the destination URL as the parameter. It's in this method where one would implement displaying the necessary information to the user, allowing them to make a decision on whether or not they consent to using the service. 

Operations that will trigger the consent flow are:

- One
- Two

### Consent Options

- **AcceptAlways**: Consent and remember the decision.
- **Accept**: Consent once.
- **Reject**: Do not consent.

When the SDK requests user consent with this method, the client
application should present the URL to the user. Client applications should
provide some means of obtaining user consent and return the appropriate
Consent enum that corresponds to the user's decision.

### Sample Consent Delegate Implementation

#### consent_delegate_impl.h

```cpp
class ConsentDelegateImpl final : public mip::ConsentDelegate {
public:
  ConsentDelegateImpl() = default;
  
  virtual mip::Consent GetUserConsent(const std::string& url) override;

};
```

#### consent_delegate_impl.cpp

When the SDK requires consent, the `GetUserConsent` method is called *by the SDK*, and the URL passed in as a parameter. In the sample below, the user is notified that the SDK will connect to that provided URL, then returns `Consent::AcceptAlways`. This isn't a great example as the user wasn't presented with a real choice.

```cpp
Consent ConsentDelegateImpl::GetUserConsent(const string& url) {
  //Print the consent URL, ask user to choose
  std::cout << "SDK will connect to: " << url << std::endl;

  std::cout << "1) Accept Always" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "2) Accept" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "3) Reject" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Select an option: ";
  char input;
  std::cin >> input;

  switch (input)
  {
  case '1':
    return Consent::AcceptAlways;
    break;
  case '2':
    return Consent::Accept;
    break;
  case '3':
    return Consent::Reject;
    break;
  default:
    return Consent::Reject;
  }  
}
```
