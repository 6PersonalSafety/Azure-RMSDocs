# Quickstart: List sensitivity labels (C++)

Introductory paragraph.
<!--- Answer the fundamental "why would I want to do this?" question. --->

Perhaps use https://github.com/tommoser/build-ILL-mip-sdk/wiki/Build-2018-Workshop-Instructions 

In this quickstart, you will <do X>

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already, be sure to complete the following prerequisites before continuing:

- Complete the [Quickstart: Client application initialization](quick-app-initialization-cpp.md) first.
- Review [Classification labels](concept-classification-labels.md) concepts.

## Procedure 1

Listing Labels: https://github.com/tommoser/build-ILL-mip-sdk/wiki/Build-2018-Workshop-Instructions#listing-labels
File Handler: https://github.com/tommoser/build-ILL-mip-sdk/wiki/Build-2018-Workshop-Instructions#filehandler 
Also: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Azure-RMSDocs-pr/blob/release-mip/mip/develop/tutorial-file/engine.md
Also: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Azure-RMSDocs-pr/blob/release-mip/mip/develop/tutorial-file/file-handler.md 

Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the
procedure.

   <!---Use screenshots but be judicious to maintain a reasonable length. Make
    sure screenshots align to the
    [current standards](contribute-mvc-screen-shots.md).
   If users access your product/service via a web browser the first screenshot
   should always include the full browser window in Chrome or Safari. This is
   to show users that the portal is browser-based - OS and browser agnostic.--->
1. Step four of the procedure

## Procedure 2

1. Step two of the procedure
1. Step three of the procedure

## Procedure 3

Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the procedure.

## Next Steps

Now that you've learned how to write the initialization code and list sensitivity labels, try the next quickstart:
