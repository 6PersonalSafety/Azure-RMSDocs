# Quickstart: Read a sensitivity labels (C++)

This Quickstart shows you how to use the MIP File API, to read a sensitivity label assigned to a file.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already, be sure to complete the following prerequisites before continuing:

- Complete [Quickstart: Apply a sensitivity label (C++)](quick-file-apply-label-cpp.md) first, shows you how to apply a sensitivity label that was assigned to a file. This Quickstart builds on the previous one.
- Optionally: Review [Classification labels](concept-classification-labels.md) concepts.

============== WIP BELOW THIS LINE ======================

## Add logic to read a sensitivity label

Add logic to a read a sensitivity label that was assigned to a file, using the File engine object. 

1. Open the Visual Studio solution you worked on in the previous "Quickstart: List sensitivity labels (C++)" article.
