# Quickstart: Read a sensitivity labels (C++)

This Quickstart shows you how to use the MIP File API, to read a sensitivity label assigned to a file.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already, be sure to complete the following prerequisites before continuing:

- Complete the [Quickstart: List sensitivity labels (C++)](quick-file-list-labels-cpp.md) first, which builds a starter Visual Studio solution, to list an organization's sensitivity labels.
- Optionally: Review [Classification labels](concept-classification-labels.md) concepts.

## Add logic to read a sensitivity label

Add logic to a read a sensitivity label that was assigned to a file, using the File engine object. 

1. Open the Visual Studio solution you worked on in the previous "Quickstart: List sensitivity labels (C++)" Quickstart.

## Next Steps

Now that you've learned how to read a sensitivity label, try the next quickstart:
