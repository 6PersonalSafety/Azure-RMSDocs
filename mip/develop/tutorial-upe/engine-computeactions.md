## Summary

The primary purpose of the Policy API is to compute the actions that a specific label should take when selected by a user or process. This is accomplished by using `mip::PolicyEngine::ComputeActions()`. The result is a collection of `mip::Actions` that should be taken by the application. These actions can include adding or removing metadata, applying content marking, and applying protection.
