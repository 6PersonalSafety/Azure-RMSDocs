# House rules for comments on the Azure Information Protection documentation

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), [Office 365](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf)*

If you have feedback about the documentation you've just read for Azure Information Protection, we would love to hear from you. For example, if you have a clarifying question about the information that is documented, you want to report an inaccuracy in the documentation, or you can’t find the information that you need. 

To do that, in the **Feedback** section of the relevant page, select **Sign in to give documentation feedback** to sign in with a GitHub account to use GitHub Issues. If you are already signed in, you see **Content feedback** instead. 

However, if your feedback isn't about the documentation itself, select **Product feedback**, or use the following resources:
 
- **Subscription questions for your organization**. For example, whether your existing subscriptions support a feature that you want to use, or you have questions about whether users need specific licenses and you have checked the [subscription requirements for Azure Information Protection](./get-started/requirements.md#subscription-for-azure-information-protection). Instead, contact your Microsoft Account Manager or [Microsoft Support](./get-started/information-support.md#to-contact-microsoft-support).
    
- **Technical support**. For example, a feature isn’t working and you have checked any requirements and followed the documentation instructions. You have also checked that you're using a [supported version](./rms-client/client-version-release-history.md#servicing-information-and-timelines) of the Azure Information Protection client. Instead, contact [Microsoft Support](./get-started/information-support.md#to-contact-microsoft-support) or use your standard support channels. Alternatively, engage with the community on the Azure Information Protection [Yammer site](https://www.yammer.com/AskIPTeam).

- **Roadmap information**. For example, when a new release will be available or additional functionality is planned. For this information, visit the [Enterprise Mobility and Security Blog](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/?product=azure-information-protection,azure-rights-management-services) or ask about it on the Azure Information Protection [Yammer site](https://www.yammer.com/AskIPTeam). You can also check the [UserVoice site](https://msip.uservoice.com) for Azure Information Protection and use this resource to request new features.

- **Product feedback**. For example, suggestions for product improvements or a new feature. Instead, visit the [UserVoice site](https://msip.uservoice.com) for Azure Information Protection to propose new capabilities, vote on ideas others have posted, and see the current status as triaged by the Azure Information Protection team. When you request new features or vote for features, sign in with your company email address so that we can contact you for additional information. For general feedback, questions, and advice, engage with the community on the Azure Information Protection [Yammer site](https://www.yammer.com/AskIPTeam). 

- **Documentation design feedback**. For example, you want to report a problem or request a new feature for all documentation pages on the docs.microsoft.com site. Instead, visit the documentation [feedback site](https://msdocs.uservoice.com/forums/364242-general-site-feedback) to post your suggestion or vote on other suggestions. You might also find it useful to read [Introducing docs.microsoft.com](/teamblog/introducing-docs-microsoft-com/) to learn more about the site design and new features.

You’ll find additional resources in [Information and support for Azure Information Protection](./get-started/information-support.md). 

Note: If you are a Microsoft employee,  please use internal communication channels.
