# Azure Information Protection Developer's Guide

This guide will orient you to tools for extending and integrating with Azure Information Protection’s rights management service. The intent of this guide is allow developers who want to leverage the rights management system to build different types of applications for a range of supported platforms.

>The current Azure Information Protection SDK has the rights management component and the classification and labelling are under development.

## Service Applications
Service applications provide capabilities to protect information when exporting from an enterprise content management system, a business application, or a cloud based business solution. Data Leakage Protection (DLP) and Cloud Application Security (CAS) applications are examples of service applications. Our SDK for developing service applications is available through two programming models.

- [C++](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38397)
- [C# Managed API](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Information-Protection-Samples/tree/master/IpcManagedAPI)


### Examples of service applications
- [IpcDlp](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-rms) is a sample RMS-enabled DLP application that takes you through the basic steps that a DLP RMS-enabled application should perform by using the RMS File API for protecting and consuming restricted content.
- [IpcAzureApp](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-rms) is a sample that demonstrates how to use RMS SDK in Azure applications to protect data in an Azure Blob Storage.
- [RmsFileWatcher](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-rms) is a sample that demonstrates how to build a Windows application that watches directories in the file system and applies RMS protection policies on every change, for example file added or file modified.

## PowerShell guides
These scripts, generally used by Azure Rights management administrators, are useful for developing and testing your service applications.
- [Azure Rights Management Cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn629398.aspx) let you administer Azure RMS from the command line. Although this enables automation, it also supports reliable and repeated processes to help reduce administrative overheads. In addition, some Azure RMS advanced configurations and operations require Azure PowerShell.+
- [RMS Protection Cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt433195.aspx) can be used with Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS) data protection from Azure Information Protection, or with Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) and supplement other PowerShell modules for these Rights Management deployments. Use these RMS Protection cmdlets to bulk protect and unprotect files for any file type


## User applications
User Applications are built using both the RMS SDK 2.1 and RMS SDK 4.2.
The 4.2 version is a REST based client. The 2.1 version is used for building native Windows based applications.

### User application development process guides
- [Developing your application](developing-your-application.md)
- [Testing your application](how-to-set-up-your-test-environment.md)
- [Deploying your application](deploying-your-application.md)


### User application samples
- [AzureIP Test](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Information-Protection-Samples/tree/master/AzureIP_Test) is a sample console application that allows you to encrypt documents with an Azure template or an ad-hoc policy.
- [IPCNotepad](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Information-Protection-Samples/tree/master/AzureIP_Test) is a sample RMS-enabled application that takes you through the basic steps each RMS-enabled application should perform when protecting and consuming restricted content.
- [RmsDocumentInspector](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-rms) is a tool can give information about any RMS protected file such as content-id or user rights.

## Development environment setup
The following guides lead you through OS specific setup steps for an application development environment using common tools.

|[![iOS/OSX setup](../media/develop/ios-icon.png)](ios-sdk.md) | [![Android setup](../media/develop/android-icon.png)](android-sdk.md) | [![Windows Phone setup](../media/develop/windows-phone-icon.png)](windows-phone-apps.md) | [![Windows Service setup](../media/develop/windows-icon.png)](install-the-rms-sdk.md) | [![Linux setup](../media/develop/linux-icon.png)](linux-setup.md) |

## How-tos
Each of the following topics presents specific guidance for an aspect of implementing your application. Service applications are built using the RMS SDK 2.x. User applications are built using RMS SDK 4.x. The article link is attributed with the application type; service, user.
