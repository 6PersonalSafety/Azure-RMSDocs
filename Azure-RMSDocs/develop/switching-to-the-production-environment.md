# Switching to the production environment

This section will guide you through the process of releasing your tested application to a production environment.

The steps involved are:

-   Request a Production License Agreement

    This step should be executed with ample lead time for your project because it can take several weeks for this process to complete.

-   Sign your Rights-enabled application
-   Installation options for Active Directory Rights Management Services Client 2.1

The following topics will guide you through the process.

- [Obtaining a production license](obtaining-a-production-license.md)

  Before you can release an application developed using the Rights Management Services SDK 2.1, you must apply for a Production License Agreement to obtain a production certificate.
- [Signing your application for production](signing-your-application-for-production.md)

  This topic leads you through the process of signing your application for production mode.

- [Deploying your application](deploying-your-application.md)

  This topic outlines and guides you through deployment options for your rights-enabled application.
