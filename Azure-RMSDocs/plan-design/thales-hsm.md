*Applies to: Azure Rights Management, Office 365*

The information in this article has been removed because it is no longer relevant now that Azure Rights Management uses Azure Key Vault for customer-managed tenant keys (also known as bring your own key, or BYOK). For more information about this change, see <blog post title> on the [Enterprise Mobility and Security Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/?product=azure-rights-management-services).
