# More information about Thales HSMs and Microsoft additions
Azure RMS uses Thales HSMs to protect your keys when you manage your own tenant key (the bring your own key scenario, or BYOK).

Thales e-Security is a leading global provider of data encryption and cyber security solutions to the financial services, high technology, manufacturing, government, and technology sectors. With a 40-year track record of protecting corporate and government information, Thales solutions are used by four of the five largest energy and aerospace companies, 22 NATO countries, and secure more than 80 per cent of worldwide payment transactions.

Microsoft has collaborated with Thales to enhance the state of art for HSMs. These enhancements enable you to get the typical benefits of hosted services without relinquishing control over your keys. Specifically, these enhancements let Microsoft manage the HSMs so that you do not have to. As a cloud service, Azure RMS scales up at short notice to meet your organization’s usage spikes. At the same time, your key is protected inside Microsoft’s HSMs: You retain control over the key lifecycle because you generate the key and transfer it to Microsoft’s HSMs.

For more information, see [Thales HSMs and Azure RMS](http://www.thales-esecurity.com/msrms/cloud) on the Thales web site.
