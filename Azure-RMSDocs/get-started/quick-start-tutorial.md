Use this tutorial to quickly try out Microsoft Azure Rights Management (also known as Azure RMS) for your organization with just 5 steps that should take you less than 15 minutes. You’ll activate the service, securely send a confidential document by email to somebody in another organization, and then be able to track when that document is opened. When the confidential document is emailed, it is encrypted while in transit and can be read only by the person it is sent to, using the permissions that are set by the sender.

This tutorial is aimed at IT administrators and consultants, to help them evaluate Azure Rights Management as an information protection solution for an organization. In a production environment, the instructions to activate the service would be done by an administrator and the instructions to send the document would be done by end users. Both sets of instructions are included in this tutorial, to demonstrate the end-to-end scenario of securely sending a confidential document to somebody in another organization. If you have any problems completing this tutorial, send an email message to [AskIPTeam](mailto:askipteam@microsoft.com?subject=Having%20problems%20with%20the%20Quick%20Start%20tutorial) and we will help you out.

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following:

-   A subscription that supports Azure Rights Management. This can be a paid subscription or a trial subscription. If you want to use document tracking, which is required for step 5 in this tutorial, your subscription must support document tracking. For more information about the subscription options and links to free trials, see [Azure RMS requirements: Cloud subscriptions that support Azure RMS](requirements-subscriptions.md).

    Tip: If you need to get a subscription, do this in advance because this process can sometimes take a while to complete.

-   An administrator account to sign in to the Office 365 admin center or the Azure classic portal, so that you can activate the Rights Management service. This account must also have an email address and a working email service (for example, Exchange Online or Exchange Server).

-   A computer running Windows (minimum of Windows 7 SP1), and which has installed either Office 2016, Office 2013, or Office 2010.

Let's get started.
