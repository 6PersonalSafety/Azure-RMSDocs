# Frequently asked questions for Azure Information Protection

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection, Office 365*

Have a question about Azure Information Protection, or for the Azure Rights Management service (Azure RMS)? See if it's answered here.

These FAQ pagse will be updated regularly, with new additions listed in the monthly documentation update announcements on the [Enterprise Mobility and Security Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/?product=azure-rights-management-services).

## What's the difference between Azure Information Protection and Azure Rights Management?

Azure Information Protection provides classification, labeling, and protection for an organization's documents and emails. The protection technology uses the Azure Rights Management service; now a component of Azure Information Protection.

This means that all documents and emails that are protected by using the Azure Rights Management service do so by using Azure Information Protection. But you can use Azure Information Protection without using the Azure Rights Management service.
