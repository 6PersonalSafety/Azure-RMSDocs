> [!NOTE]
> For this step, you must have a subscription that supports document tracking. To check whether your subscription includes document tracking, see [Comparison of Rights Management Services (RMS) Offerings](https://technet.microsoft.com/dn858608.aspx).

This step is optional, but most people like to know if the attachment they sent to people has been opened, when, and even from where. For example:

-   You’re expecting a response from somebody by a specified time and you can see from the document tracking site that she hasn’t opened the document even though the deadline is approaching. You send her a follow-up email or telephone her as a timely reminder.

-   After seeing that somebody has opened the document, you follow up to ask her if she has any questions or requires additional information.

### To track your protected document

1.  Using Outlook, on the **Home** tab, in the **RMS** group, click **Track Usage**.

2.  If you see the **Protect and share on your terms** page, click **Sign in** and supply your user name and password again.

3.  On the **Your shared documents** page, you’ll see the document that you attached to the email, **Confidential.docx**. At this point, it’s the only file displayed but as you share additional protected documents, the list will grow.

    From this page, you’ll see when you shared the document (when you sent the email with the protected attachment), the date of the last activity, and the name of the recipient you sent the email to. Click the document name for additional details.

4.  On the new page, which has the name of the file that you clicked, you’ll see summary details for that document only, and a list of other options that are available for the document (**List**, **Timeline**, **Map**, **Settings**).

    Click each option to explore different ways to track your protected document. Or, still on the **Summary** page, click **Open in Excel** to export the information to a spreadsheet, or click **Revoke access** to stop sharing the document.

You can return to this site to track further activity for your protected document, or revoke access if necessary. You can even access the site from your mobile device or tablet, by using a browser with this link: [document tracking](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529562)
