# House rules for customer posts on the Microsoft documentation site for Azure Information Protection

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection, Office 365*

If you have feedback about the documentation on this page, we would love to hear from you. For example, if you have a clarifying question about the information documented, want to report a problem with the documentation, or can’t find the information that you need. Please note that these posts are public and visible to everybody. 
 
Livefyre posts and sidenotes should not be used for the following:
 
- **Technical support**. For example, a feature isn’t working after checking any requirements and following the documentation instructions, or you have a question about licensing. Instead, use your standard support channels or [contact Microsoft Support](../get-started/information-support.md#to-contact-microsoft-support).

- **Roadmap information**. For example, when a new release will be available or additional functionality is planned. For this information, visit the [Enterprise Mobility and Security Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/?product=azure-information-protection,azure-rights-management-services) or if it is critical to your deployment, email [askipteam](mailto:%20askipteam@microsoft.com).

- **Product feedback**. For example, suggestions for product improvements or a new feature. Instead, visit the [Yammer site for Information Protection](https://www.yammer.com/AskIPTeam) to engage with the engineering team.

- **Documentation design feedback**. For example, you want to report a problem or request a few feature for all documentation pages on the docs.microsoft.com site. Instead, visit our [feedback site](https://msdocs.uservoice.com/forums/364242-general-site-feedback) to post your suggestion or vote on other suggestions. You might also find it useful to read [Introducing docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/teamblog/introducing-docs-microsoft-com/) to learn more about the site design and new features.


You’ll find additional resources in [Information and support for Azure Information Protection](..get-started/information-support.md). 
 

Note: If you are a Microsoft employee,  please use internal communication channels.
