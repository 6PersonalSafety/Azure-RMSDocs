# Quick start tutorial for Azure Information Protection 

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection*

Use this tutorial to quickly try out Azure Information Protection for your organization, with just 5 steps that should take you about 30 minutes. You’ll activate the Azure Rights Management service, look at and modify the default Azure Information Protection policy, install the client and application, and then you're ready to see Azure Information Protection in action. You'll first use a Word document to see classification, labeling, and protection in action. And then safely share a Word document by email and track how it is used.

This tutorial is aimed at IT administrators and consultants, to help them evaluate Azure Information Protection as an enterprise information protection solution for an organization. In a production environment, the instructions to configure the Information Protection policy and install the clients for users would be done by an administrator. The instructions to label the document and safely share a document by email and track it would done by end users. Both sets of instructions are included in this tutorial, to demonstrate typical end-to-end scenarios of classifying, labeling, and protecting your organization's data.

## Prerequisites 
To complete this tutorial, you will need the following:

- A subscription that includes Azure Information Protection for classification, labeling, and protection. This tutorial includes some of the advanced features, such as automated data classification with user recommendations. Make sure that your subscription supports these features. For more information, see the [subscription information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827589).

- A subscription for Azure, so you can access the Azure portal, to configure the Azure Information Protection policy. If you do not already have an Azure subscription for your organization, you can get one by signing up for a free trial: Go to the [Azure Get started page](https://account.windowsazure.com/organization) and follow the instructions.

  > [!TIP] 
  > If you need to get one or more of these subscriptions, do this in advance because this process can sometimes take a while to complete.

- A global administrator account to sign in to the Azure portal to configure the Azure Information Protection policy. This account must also have an email address and a working email service (for example, Exchange Online or Exchange Server).

- A computer running Windows (minimum of Windows 7 with Service Pack 1), and which has installed either Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Professional Plus 2013 with Service Pack 1, or Office Professional Plus 2010. 

Let's get started.
