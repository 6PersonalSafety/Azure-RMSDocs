# What is Azure Information Protection (preview)

Azure Information Protection (AIP) is a new service built on both [Azure Rights Management](/rights-management) and [Secure Islands](http://www.secureislands.com/). AIP helps you classify and protect your data, and applies persistent labels to your data so that it's identifiable at all times, regardless of where it is stored or with whom it is shared.

Visual marking, encryption and usage rights can be automatically attached the applied labels to further protect your data and to help prevent data loss. 

Azure Information Protection provides a simple and intuitive user interface, and does not interrupt your normal working experience.  

Current Azure RMS customers will continue to enjoy the same capabilities with no change to their service. Upon General Availability of Azure Information Protection later this calendar year, Azure RMS customers will receive new expanded, capabilities. 

More information on how to buy Azure Information Protection will be available closer to General Availability. In the meanwhile you can [visit the AIP product page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/azure-information-protection), watch [an introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9Ip0m6d3G0) to learn more, and [sign up to preview the service](https://info.microsoft.com/Azure-Information-Protection.html?ls=Website).
