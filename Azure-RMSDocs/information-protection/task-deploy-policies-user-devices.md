# Task: Deploying policies to user devices

After defining every configuration in your policy, you save it locally. However, in order for the changes to be available to all the users in the organizations, you need to **publish** the entire policy.  
To publish the entire policy:

1. On the Azure Information Protection admin console, click `Save`.
2. Click` Publish` to make this policy available for Azure Information Protection clients.

> [!NOTE]
> The policy will be downloaded to the client only after restarting Office applications.
