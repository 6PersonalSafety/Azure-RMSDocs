# Quick start tutorial for Azure Information Protection 

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection*

Use this tutorial to quickly try out Azure Information Protection preview for your organization, with just 3 steps that should take you less than 15 minutes. You’ll look at and modify the default Azure Information Protection policy, install the Azure Information Protection client, and then use a Word document to see classification, labeling, and protection in action.

This tutorial is aimed at IT administrators and consultants, to help them evaluate Azure Information Protection as an enterprise information protection solution for an organization. In a production environment, the instructions to configure the Information Protection policy, and install the client for users would be done by an administrator. The instructions to label the document would be done by end users. Both sets of instructions are included in this tutorial, to demonstrate the end-to-end scenario of classifying, labeling, and protecting your organization's data. 

If you have any problems completing this tutorial, using Azure Information Protection, or want to see what others are saying about it, head over to the [Azure Information Protection Yammer site](https://www.yammer.com/askipteam/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=8652489&view=all).

## Prerequisites 
To complete this tutorial, you will need the following:

- A subscription that includes Azure Information Protection for classification and labeling, and a subscription that includes protecting Office documents and emails by using Azure Rights Management. For more information about the available subscriptions and links to free trials, see the marketing site.

- A subscription for Azure, so you can access the Azure portal, to configure the Azure Information Protection policy. If you do not already have an Azure subscription for your organization, you can get one by signing up for a free trial: Go to the [Azure Get started page](https://account.windowsazure.com/organization) and follow the instructions.

  > [!TIP] 
  > If you need to get one or more of these subscriptions, do this in advance because this process can sometimes take a while to complete.

- The Azure Rights Management service must be activated. If your subscription that includes the Azure Rights Management service is recent (for example, beginning October 2016), the service is automatically activated and no additional steps are required. If you need to manually activate the service, see [Activating Azure Rights Management](../deploy-use/active-service.md).

- A global administrator account to sign in to the Azure portal to configure the Azure Information Protection policy. This account must also have an email address and a working email service (for example, Exchange Online or Exchange Server).

- A computer running Windows (minimum of Windows 7 with Service Pack 1), and which has installed either Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Professional Plus 2013 with Service Pack 1, or Office Professional Plus 2010. 

Let's get started.
