# Other applications that support the RMS APIs
Use the following information to help you understand how Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS) can support other applications to protect your organizationâ€™s data.

By using the RMS SDK, your internal developers can write line-of-business applications to natively support [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../includes/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)]. How information protection is integrated with these applications depends on how they are written. For example, the integration might be automatically applied with minimal user interaction required, or for a more customized experience, users might be prompted to configure settings to apply information protection to files. For more information about the SDK, see the [Microsoft Rights Management SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh552972%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).

Similarly, many software vendors provide applications to provide  information protection solutions, also known as enterprise rights management (ERM) products. A popular example is a PDF reader that supports [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_2](../includes/aad_rightsmanagement_2_md.md)] for specific platforms. You can use the table in the [Client device capabilities](requirements-for-azure-rights-management.md#BKMK_ClientCapabilities) section of the [Requirements for Azure Rights Management](requirements-for-azure-rights-management.md) topic to identify applications that support RMS (RMS-enlightened applications), and then use a web search to purchase or download the application.
