# Overview

Rights Management Services (RMS) is an information protection technology that helps safeguard digital information from unauthorized use. Through your rights-enabled application, content owners will be able to define who can open, modify, print, forward, or take other actions with the content.

## Overview

AD RMS consists of both [server](ad_rms_server.md) and [client](ad_rms_client.md) components. The server components include multiple web services that run on a Windows Server such as Windows Server 2008 R2 or via the cloud through RMS web services in Azure. The client component can be run on either a client or server operating system and contains functions that enable an application to encrypt and decrypt content, retrieve templates and revocation lists, acquire licenses and certificates from a server, and other related rights management tasks.

For more information, see [Application types](application_types.md).

The following are just a few of the scenarios to which applications built on the Rights Management Services SDK 2.1 can be applied.

-   A law firm wants to prevent sensitive email messages from being printed or forwarded.
-   The developers of computer-aided design and manufacturing software want to limit drawing access to a small group of users within the research division without requiring the use of passwords.
-   The owners of a graphic design website want to use a single license that allows free viewing of low-resolution copies of their images but requires payment for access to the high-resolution versions.
-   The owners of an online document library want to enable rights to view, print, or edit documents based on the identity of the user.
-   A corporation wants to publish sensitive employee information to an internal website that restricts viewing and editing privileges to certain users.
