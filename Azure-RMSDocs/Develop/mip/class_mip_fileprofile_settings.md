## Members
  
### Settings
[FileProfile::Settings](class_mip_fileprofile_settings.md) constructor.

Parameters:  
* **path**: File path under which logging, telemetry, and other persistent state is stored 


* **useInMemoryStorage**: Whether or not all state should be stored in memory (as opposed to on disk) 


* **isLicenseCachingEnabled**: Enable or disable caching of protection licenses 


* **authDelegate**: Auth delegate used for acquiring authentication tokens 


* **observer**: [Observer](class_mip_fileprofile_observer.md) instance which will receive notifications of events related to [FileProfile](class_mip_fileprofile.md)


* **applicationInfo**: Info regarding application that is consuming the SDK


  
### GetPath
Gets the path under which logging, telemetry, and other persistent state is stored.

  
**Returns**: Path under which logging, telemetry, and other persistent state is stored
  
### GetUseInMemoryStorage
Gets whether or not all state should be stored in memory (as opposed to on disk)

  
**Returns**: Whether or not all state should be stored in memory (as opposed to on disk)
  
### IsLicenseCachingEnabled
Get whether or caching of licenses is enabled.

  
**Returns**: True if caches are stored in memory only
  
### GetAuthDelegate
Gets the auth delegate used for acquiring authentication tokens.

  
**Returns**: Auth delegate used for acquiring authentication tokens
  
### ConsentDelegate
Gets the consent delegate used to request user consent connecting to services.

  
**Returns**: Consent delegate used for requesting user consent
  
### Observer
Gets the observer which receives notifications of events related to [FileProfile](class_mip_fileprofile.md).

  
**Returns**: [Observer](class_mip_fileprofile_observer.md) which receives notifications of events related to [FileProfile](class_mip_fileprofile.md)
  
### ApplicationInfo
Gets info regarding application that is consuming the SDK.

  
**Returns**: Info regarding application that is consuming the SDK
  
### GetSkipTelemetryInit
Gets whether or not telemetry initialization should be skipped.

  
**Returns**: Whether or not telemetry initialization should be skipped
  
### SetSkipTelemetryInit
Disables telemetry initialization.
This should not normally be called by client applications, rather it is used by File SDK (which already initializes telemetry) to prevent duplicate initialization
  
### LoggerDelegate
Get the logger delegate (if any) provided by the application.

  
**Returns**: Logger delegate to be used for logging
  
### SetLoggerDelegate
Use external logger implementation.
This should be called by client applications if they want to use their own logger implementation
  
### OptOutTelemetry
Opts out of all telemetry gathering.
  
### IsTelemetryOptedOut
Gets whether or not telemetry gathering should be disabled.

  
**Returns**: Whether or not telemetry gathering should be disabled
  
### SetSessionId
Sets the session id.

Parameters:  
* **sessionId**: Session id which will be used to correlate logs/telemetry


  
### GetSessionId
Gets the session id.

  
**Returns**: Session id which will be used to correlate logs/telemetry
