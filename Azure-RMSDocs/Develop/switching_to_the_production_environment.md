Switching to the production environment
=======================================================================================================

This section will guide you through the process of releasing your tested application to a production environment.

The steps involved are:

-   Request a Production License Agreement

    This step should be executed with ample lead time for your project because it can take several weeks for this process to complete.

-   Sign your Rights-enabled application
-   Installation options for Active Directory Rights Management Services Client 2.1

The following topics will guide you through the process.
