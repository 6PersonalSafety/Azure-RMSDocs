# How to activate Azure Rights Management from the Office 365 admin center preview

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection, Office 365*


Use these instructions only if you're using the new, preview version of the Office 365 admin center (**Office 365 Admin center preview**).

Note that because this version of the admin center is in preview, and because of the ongoing rebranding of Azure Rights Management to Azure Information Protection, instructions for this version of the admin center are less reliable than using the classic version of the admin center. Different customers might see different options in this admin center.

1. After you have signed up for an Office 365 plan that includes Rights Management, [sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account](https://portal.office.com/) that is a global administrator for your OfficeÂ 365 deployment.

2. If the Office 365 admin center does not automatically display, select the app launcher icon in the upper-left and choose **Admin**. The **Admin** tile appears only to Office 365 administrators.

    > [!TIP]
    > For admin center help, see [About the Office 365 admin center - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/About-the-Office-365-admin-center-Admin-Help-58537702-d421-4d02-8141-e128e3703547).

3. Navigate to the **rights management** page, or use the search functionality.

    We suggest you navigate if you are new to the preview version and find it useful to see related configuration options, and use search if you are familiar with the preview version and want to go straight to activating Azure Rights Management. You might also need to use the search option during the preview version of the admin center, if the navigation instructions do not match what you see.

    - To navigate: **Settings** > **Services & add-ins** > **Microsoft Azure Information Protection** > **Manage Microsoft Azure Information Protection settings**

    - To search: In the search box on the **Home** page, type **Information Protection**, and from the search results, click **Microsoft Azure Information Protection**, and then **Manage Microsoft Azure Information Protection settings**. If no search results are returned, try typing **Rights Management**, and then from the search results, click **Microsoft Azure rights management settings**.

        > [!NOTE]
        >If you navigate to this option, depending on your display, you might need to scroll to see this option. However, if it is not listed on the page and it is not returned in the search results, it might be because your service plan does not include the Azure Rights Management service for Azure Information Protection.
        >
        >To activate the Azure Rights Management service, you must have either an [Azure Information Protection Premium plan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/azure-information-protection-pricing) or an [Office 365 plan that includes Rights Management](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf). For help with this issue, send an email message to [askipteam](mailto:askipteam?subject=I%20cannot%20activate%20RMS).

4. On the **rights management** page, click **activate**.

5. When prompted **Do you want to activate Rights Management?**, click **activate**.

You should now see **Rights management is activated** and the option to deactivate.
