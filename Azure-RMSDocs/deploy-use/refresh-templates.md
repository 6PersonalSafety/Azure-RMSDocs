# Refreshing templates for users

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection, Office 365*

When you use the Azure Rights Management service of Azure Information Protection, templates are automatically downloaded to client computers so that users can select them from their applications. However, you might need to take additional steps if you make changes to the templates:

|Application or service|How templates are refreshed after changes|
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|Exchange Online|Manual configuration required to refresh templates.<br /><br />For the configuration steps, see the following section, [Exchange Online only: How to configure Exchange to download changed custom templates](#exchange-online-only-how-to-configure-exchange-to-download-changed-custom-templates).|
|Office 365|Automatically refreshed - no additional steps required.|
|Office 2016 and Office 2013<br /><br />RMS sharing application for Windows|Automatically refreshed - on a schedule:<br /><br />For these later versions of Office: The default refresh interval  is every 7 days.<br /><br />For the RMS sharing application for Windows: Starting with version 1.0.1784.0, the default refresh interval is every 1 day. Prior versions have a default refresh interval of every 7 days.<br /><br />To force a refresh sooner than this schedule, see the following section, [Office 2016, Office 2013, and RMS sharing application for Windows: How to force a refresh for a changed custom template](#office-2016--office-2013-and-rms-sharing-application-for-windows-how-to-force-a-refresh-for-a-changed-custom-template).|
|Office 2010|Refreshed when users log on.<br /><br />To force a refresh, ask or force users to log off and log back on again. Or, see the following section, [Office 2010 only: How to force a refresh for a changed custom template](#office-2010-only-how-to-force-a-refresh-for-a-changed-custom-template).|
For mobile devices that use the RMS sharing application, templates are automatically downloaded (and refreshed if necessary) without additional configuration required.

## Exchange Online only: How to configure Exchange to download changed custom templates
If you have already configured Information Rights Management (IRM) for Exchange Online, custom templates will not download for users until you make the following changes by using Windows PowerShell in Exchange Online.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about how to use Windows PowerShell in Exchange Online, see [Using PowerShell with Exchange Online](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj200677%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx).

You must do this procedure each time you change a template.

### To update templates for Exchange Online

1.  Using Windows PowerShell in Exchange Online, connect to the service:

    1.  Supply your Office 365 user name and password:

        ```
        $Cred = Get-Credential
        ```

    2.  Connect to the Exchange Online service by running the following two commands:

        ```
        $Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.outlook.com/powershell/ -Credential $Cred -Authentication Basic â€“AllowRedirection
        ```

        ```
        Import-PSSession $Session
        ```

2.  Use the [Import-RMSTrustedPublishingDomain](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj200724%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx) cmdlet to re-import your trusted publishing domain (TPD) from Azure RMS:

    ```
    Import-RMSTrustedPublishingDomain -Name "<TPD name>" -RefreshTemplates -RMSOnline
    ```
    For example, if your TPD name is **RMS Online - 1** (a typical name for many organizations), enter: **Import-RMSTrustedPublishingDomain -Name "RMS Online - 1" -RefreshTemplates -RMSOnline**

    > [!NOTE]
    > To verify your TPD name, you can use the [Get-RMSTrustedPublishingDomain](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj200707%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx) cmdlet.

3.  To confirm that the templates have imported successfully, wait a few minutes and then run the [Get-RMSTemplate](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd297960%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx) cmdlet and set the Type to All. For example:

    ```
    Get-RMSTemplate -TrustedPublishingDomain "RMS Online - 1" -Type All
    ```
    > [!TIP]
    > It's useful to keep a copy of the output so that you can easily copy the template names or GUIDs if you later archive a template.

4.  For each imported template that you want to be available in the Outlook Web App, you must use the [Set-RMSTemplate](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh529923%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx) cmdlet and set the Type to Distributed:

    ```
    Set-RMSTemplate -Identity "<name  or GUID of the template>" -Type Distributed
    ```
    Because Outlook Web Access caches the UI for 24 hours, users might not see the new template for up to a day.

In addition, if you archive a template (custom or default) and use Exchange Online with Office 365, users will continue to see the archived templates if they use the Outlook Web App or mobile devices that use the Exchange ActiveSync Protocol.

So that users no longer see these templates, connect to the service by using Windows PowerShell in Exchange Online, and then use the [Set-RMSTemplate](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh529923%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx) cmdlet by running the following command:

```
Set-RMSTemplate -Identity "<name or GUID of the template>" -Type Archived
```

## Office 2016,  Office 2013, and RMS sharing application for Windows: How to force a refresh for a changed custom template
By editing the registry on the computers running Office 2016, Office 2013, or the Rights Management (RMS) sharing application for Windows, you can change the automatic schedule so that changed templates are refreshed on computers more frequently than their default value. You can also force an immediate refresh by deleting the existing data in a registry value.

> [!WARNING]
> If you use the Registry Editor incorrectly, you might cause serious problems that might require you to reinstall the operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using the Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk.

### To change the automatic schedule

1.  Using a registry editor, create and set one of the following registry values:

    - To set an update frequency in days (minimum of 1 day):  Create a new registry value named **TemplateUpdateFrequency** and define an integer value for the data, which specifies the frequency in days to download any changes to a downloaded template. Use the following information to locate the registry path to create this new registry value.

        **Registry path:** HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\MSIPC

        **Type:** REG_DWORD

        **Value:** TemplateUpdateFrequency

    - To set an update frequency in seconds (minimum of 1 second):  Create a new registry value named **TemplateUpdateFrequencyInSeconds** and define an integer value for the data, which specifies the frequency in seconds to download any changes to a downloaded template. Use the following information to locate the registry path to create this new registry value.

        **Registry path:** HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\MSIPC

        **Type:** REG_DWORD

        **Value:** TemplateUpdateFrequencyInSeconds

    Make sure that you create and set one of these registry values, not both. If both are present, **TemplateUpdateFrequency** is ignored.

2.  If you want to force an immediate refresh of the templates, go to the next procedure. Otherwise, restart your Office applications and instances of File Explorer now.

### To force an immediate refresh

1.  Using a registry editor, delete the data for the **LastUpdatedTime** value. For example, the data might display **2015-04-20T15:52**; delete 2015-04-20T15:52 so that no data is displayed. Use the following information to locate the registry path to delete this registry value data.

	**Registry path:** HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\MSIPC\<*MicrosoftRMS_FQDN*>\Template

	**Type:** REG_SZ

	**Value:** LastUpdatedTime

	> [!TIP]
	    > In the registry path, <*MicrosoftRMS_FQDN*> refers to your Microsoft RMS service FQDN. If you want to verify this value:

    > 1.  Run the [Get-AadrmConfiguration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsazure/dn629410.aspx) cmdlet for Azure RMS. If you haven't already installed the Windows PowerShell module for Azure RMS, see [Installing Windows PowerShell for Azure Rights Management](install-powershell.md).
    > 2.  From the output, identify the **LicensingIntranetDistributionPointUrl** value.
    > 
    >     For example: **LicensingIntranetDistributionPointUrl   : https://5c6bb73b-1038-4eec-863d-49bded473437.rms.na.aadrm.com/_wmcs/licensing**
    > 3.  From the value, remove **https://** and **/_wmcs/licensing** from this string. The remaining value is your Microsoft RMS service FQDN. In our example, the Microsoft RMS service FQDN would be the following value:
    > 
    >     **5c6bb73b-1038-4eec-863d-49bded473437.rms.na.aadrm.com**

2.  Delete the following folder and all files it contains: **%localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIPC\Templates**

3.  Restart your Office applications and instances of File Explorer.

## Office 2010 only: How to force a refresh for a changed custom template
By editing the registry on the computers running Office 2010, you can set a value so that changed templates are refreshed on computers without waiting for users to log off and back on. You can also force an immediate refresh by deleting the existing data in a registry value.

> [!WARNING]
> If you use the Registry Editor incorrectly, you might cause serious problems that might require you to reinstall the operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using the Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk.

### To change the update frequency

1.  Using a registry editor, create a new registry value named **UpdateFrequency** and define an integer value for the data, which specifies the frequency in days to download any changes to a downloaded template. Use the following table to locate the registry path to create this new registry value.

	**Registry path:** HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MSDRM\TemplateManagement

	**Type:** REG_DWORD

	**Value:** UpdateFrequency

2.  If you want to force an immediate refresh of the templates, go to the next procedure. Otherwise, restart your Office applications now.

### To force an immediate refresh

1.  Using a registry editor, delete the data for the **LastUpdatedTime** value. For example, the data might display **2015-04-20T15:52**; delete 2015-04-20T15:52 so that no data is displayed. Use the following table to locate the registry path to delete this registry value data.

	**Registry path:** HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MSDRM\TemplateManagement

	**Type:** REG_SZ

	**Value:** lastUpdatedTime


2.  Delete the following folder and all files it contains: **%localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIPC\Templates**

3.  Restart your Office applications.
