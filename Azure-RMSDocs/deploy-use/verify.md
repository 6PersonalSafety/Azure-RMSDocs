# Verifying the Azure Rights Management service

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection, Office 365*

When the Azure Rights Management service of Azure Information Protection is activated and you have performed any additional configuration steps that are required for your organization, you can verify that this protection service is working as expected by protecting a file or email message by using one  user account, and then attempting to open and use that protected content from another user account.

To do this testing, you can use the information in [Helping users to protect files by using the Azure Rights Management service](help-users.md).

If your testing is unsuccessful, review the configuration steps in [Azure Information Protection deployment roadmap](../plan-design/deployment-roadmap.md), and use the [RMS Analyzer tool](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46437) to help identify and fix potential problems. You can also run this tool periodically, as a general health check.

> [!TIP]
> If you need additional help, see the [Support options and community resources](../get-started/information-support.md#support-options-and-community-resources) section in the [Information and support for Azure Information Protection](../get-started/information-support.md) article.

## Next steps

You can monitor how your organization is using the Azure Rights Management service by using usage logging. For more information, see [Logging and analyzing usage of the Azure Rights Management service](log-analyze-usage.md).
