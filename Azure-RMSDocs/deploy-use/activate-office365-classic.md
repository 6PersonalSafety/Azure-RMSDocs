# How to activate Azure Rights Management from the Office 365 classic admin center

*Applies to: Azure Rights Management, Office 365*


Use these instructions if you're using the classic (original) version of the Office 365 admin center.

1. After you have signed up for an Office 365 plan that includes Rights Management, [sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account](https://portal.office.com/) that is a global administrator for your OfficeÂ 365 deployment.

2. If the Office 365 admin center does not automatically display, select the app launcher icon in the upper-left and choose **Admin**. The **Admin** tile appears only to Office 365 administrators.

    > [!TIP]
    > For admin center help, see [About the Office 365 admin center - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/About-the-Office-365-admin-center-Admin-Help-58537702-d421-4d02-8141-e128e3703547).

3. In the left pane, expand **SERVICE SETTINGS**.

4.  Click **Rights Management**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >If you do not see this option, it might be because your service plan or product version does not include [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_2](../includes/aad_rightsmanagement_2_md.md)].
    >
    >Use the information in [Cloud subscriptions that support Azure RMS](../get-started/requirements-subscriptions.md) to confirm RMS support. For help with this issue, send an email message to [askipteam](mailto:askipteam?subject=I%20cannot%20activate%20RMS).

5. On the **RIGHTS MANAGEMENT** page, click **Manage**.

6. On the **rights management** page, click **activate**.

7. When prompted **Do you want to activate Rights Management?**, click **activate**.

You should now see **Rights management is activated** and the option to deactivate.
