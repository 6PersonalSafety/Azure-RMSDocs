# How to activate Azure Rights Management from the Azure portal

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection*


Use these instructions if you want to activate the Azure Rights Management service (Azure RMS) from the Azure portal. This functionality is currently in preview.

1. If you haven't already done so, open a new browser window and sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as a security admin or global admin, and then navigate to the **Azure Information Protection** blade.
    
    For example, on the hub menu, click **More services** and start typing **Information** in the Filter box. Select **Azure Information Protection**.
    
    To open the Azure Information Protection balde, you must have either an [Azure Information Protection Premium plan](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/azure-information-protection-pricing) or an [Office 365 plan that includes Rights Management](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf). If you have one of these subscriptions but see a message that a valid subscription cannot be found, send an email message to [askipteam](mailto:askipteam@microsoft.com?subject=I%20cannot%20activate%20RMS)

2. If this is the first time that you have accessed the Azure Information Protection blade and Azure Rights Management is not activated for your tenant, you are prompted to activate Azure RMS from a quick start page. 
    
    If you do not see this option, from the initial Azure Information Protection blade, select **RMS Settings (Preview)**.  
    
    Click **Activate**, and then confirm your action. 

When activation is complete, the information bar displays **Activation finished successfully**.
