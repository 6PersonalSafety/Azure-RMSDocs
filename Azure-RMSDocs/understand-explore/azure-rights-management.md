# Overview of Azure Information Protection

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection, Office 365*

Azure Information Protection helps you classify and label your documents and emails, which can be done automatically by administrators who define rules and conditions, manually by users, or a combination where users are given recommendations. For your most sensitive data, you can then protect it from unauthorized access, and control how this information is used.  
The Azure Information Protection client adds a bar to Office applications, that makes it easy for users to select classification labels. The protection is added as a configuration of the label, and uses Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS) to apply usage rights and restrictions to the document or email.   

Azure Rights Management is a cloud service that is integrated into other Microsoft cloud services and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure Active Directory. It can also be used with your own line-of-business applications and information protection solutions from software vendors, whether these applications and solutions are on-premises, or in the cloud. 

Rights Management uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies to help secure your documents and email. In comparison to standard access controls, such as NTFS permissions, protection that is applied by using Rights Management stays with the documents and emails, independently of the locationâ€”inside or outside your organization, networks, file servers, and applications. This information protection solution keeps you in control of your data, even when it is shared with other people.

For example, you can configure a report document or sales forecast spreadsheet so that it can be accessed only by people in your organization, and control whether that document can be edited, or restricted to read-only, or prevent it from being printed. You can configure emails similarly, and in addition, prevent them from being forwarded or prevent the use of the Reply All option. These protection tasks can be simplified and streamlined by using policy templates.

These templates can be part of a label's configuration, so that when a specific label is applied to a document (or email message), it is both classified and automatically protected. The templates can also be selected by users or administrators in products and services that support the Azure Rights Management technology.
