# Overview of Azure Rights Management

*Applies to: Azure Rights Management, Office 365*

Microsoft Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS) helps you protect your organization’s sensitive information from unauthorized access, and control how this information is used. Azure Rights Management is a cloud service, and is integrated into other Microsoft cloud services and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure Active Directory. It can also be used with your own line-of-business applications and information protection solutions from software vendors, whether these applications and solutions are on-premises, or in the cloud. 

Rights Management uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies to help secure your files and email. In comparison to standard access controls, such as NTFS permissions, protection that is applied by using Rights Management stays with the files and emails, independently of the location—inside or outside your organization, networks, file servers, and applications. This information protection solution keeps you in control of your data, even when it is shared with other people.

For example, you can configure a file so that it can be accessed only by people in your organization, or control whether the file can be edited, or restricted to read-only, or prevent it from being printed. You can configure emails similarly, and in addition, prevent them from being forwarded or prevent the use of the Reply All option. These protection tasks can be simplified and streamlined by using standardized policy templates.
