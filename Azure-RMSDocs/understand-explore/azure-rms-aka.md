# Azure Information Protection - also known as ...

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection, Office 365*

Azure Information Protection is the renamed cloud-based solution for Azure Rights Management, which was also known as *Azure Rights Management service*. Because RMS is a well-known abbreviation for its predecessors, you will often see Azure Rights Management abbreviated to ***Azure RMS***.

Azure Information Protection was announced for General Availability on October 1, 2016. It offers classification and labeling in addition to rights management protection for an organization's documents and emails. The protection is done by using the Azure Rights Management service. For a very small percentage of documents and emails that must be protected by an on-premises key, protection can done by using the on-premises version of the rights management technology, *Active Directory Rights Management Services* (AD RMS). This on-premises product was first released as *Windows Rights Management Services* (Windows RMS).

Other names for Azure Rights Management: This service was originally named *Windows Azure Active Directory Rights Management* (often abbreviated to Windows Azure AD Rights Management), then Windows Azure Rights Management, and then Azure Rights Management.

You might also see occasional references to *Microsoft Rights Management*, or *Microsoft Rights Management services*, which is a collective term that can include both Azure RMS and AD RMS.  The "*NEW Microsoft RMS*" was a popular label that was sometimes used  when Azure Rights Management was officially released, to emphasize the new ease of deployment in comparison to its on-premises predecessors.

Have you seen references to *Information Rights Management*, often abbreviated to *IRM*? This is the Office implementation of Rights Management, which can support both Azure RMS and AD RMS. When Azure RMS was first released, it could only be used with Office 365â€”for example, with an Office 365 E3 subscription. Then, the Azure RMS technology was extended to other subscriptions, such as the Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS) and support now includes Office 2016, Office 2013, Office 2010, and the on-premises versions of SharePoint and Exchange. When the Rights Management sharing application was released to support Azure RMS and AD RMS, these technology solutions could then protect any file type; not just Office files. 

> [!TIP]
> You'll find many of these product and service names, and their related terms in [Terminology for Azure Rights Management](../get-started/terminology.md).

Now, the Azure RMS protection is included in Azure Information Protection, which you can purchase as a standalone service, or as part of one of the security suites, Enterprise Mobility + Security suite (EMS) or Secure Productive Enterprise suite (SPE). The Azure RMS technology also remains in the Office products and services.

For more information about how you can purchase or evaluate Azure Information Protection, and the different features that are available for the subscription plans, see the [Azure Information Protection](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/azure-information-protection) marketing site.

> [!NOTE]
> As an enterprise information protection solution, Azure Information Protection and Microsoft Rights Management services do not provide digital rights management (DRM) solutions that typically protect against illegal distribution of digital software.
