# Azure Rights Management - also known as ...

>*Applies to: Azure Rights Management, Office 365*


Azure Rights Management is also known as *Azure Rights Management service*, but because it runs as a service in Azure, the "service" is often omitted from its name. It is the cloud version of *Active Directory Rights Management Services* (AD RMS), which was first released as *Windows Rights Management Services* (Windows RMS).

Because RMS is a well-known abbreviation for its predecessors, Azure Rights Management is often abbreviated to ***Azure RMS***.

Azure Rights Management was originally named *Windows Azure Active Directory Rights Management* (often abbreviated to Windows Azure AD Rights Management), then Windows Azure Rights Management, and now finally Azure Rights Management.

You might also see references to *Information Rights Management*, often abbreviated to *IRM*. This is the Office implementation of Rights Management, which can support both Azure RMS and AD RMS.  When Azure RMS was first released, it could only be used with Office 365â€”for example, with an Office 365 E3 subscription. Now, Azure RMS  is extended to other subscriptions, such as the Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS) and support now includes Office 2016, Office 2013, Office 2010, on-premises versions of SharePoint and Exchange, and Azure RMS can protect any file type. For more information, see [How applications support Azure Rights Management](applications-support.md).

You might also see occasional references to *Microsoft Rights Management*, or *Microsoft Rights Management services*, which is a collective term that can include both Azure RMS and AD RMS.  The "*NEW Microsoft RMS*" was a popular label that was sometimes used  when Azure Rights Management was officially released, to emphasize the new ease of deployment in comparison to its on-premises predecessors.

> [!TIP]
> You'll find these terms (and more) in [Terminology for Azure Rights Management](../get-started/terminology.md).

As an enterprise information protection solution, Microsoft Rights Management services do not provide digital rights management (DRM) solutions that typically protect against illegal distribution of digital software.
