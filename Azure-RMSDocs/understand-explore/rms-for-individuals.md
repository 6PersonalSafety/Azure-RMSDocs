# RMS for individuals and Azure Information Protection

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection*

RMS for individuals is a free self-service subscription for users in an organization who have been sent sensitive files that have been protected by the Azure Rights Management service from Azure Information Protection. If these users cannot be authenticated because their IT department does not manage an account for them in Azure, they can use this free sign-up service. For example, the IT department doesn't have Office 365 or use Azure services.

These users can sign up for a free work or school account to use with Azure Information Protection, and download and install the Azure Information Protection client. As a result, these users can now authenticate to prove that they are the person that the protected files were sent to, and then read the protected files on computers or mobile devices.

Using the Azure Information Protection client on Windows computers, these users can also protect files so that they can be safely shared with others. If they share with people outside their organization, they too can sign up for an RMS for individuals account to read the protected file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This free subscription ensures that authorized people can always read files that have been protected. Currently, you can also use this free subscription to protect documents, but the ability to protect content is intended for trial use only and might be removed in the future. 

For more information about how you can protect files by using the Azure Information Protection client, see the [Azure Information Protection guide for users](../rms-client/client-user-guide.md).

RMS for individuals is an example of a self-service signup that is supported by Azure Active Directory. For more information about how this works, see [What is Self-Service Signup for Azure?](/active-directory/active-directory-self-service-signup) in the Azure Active Directory documentation.
