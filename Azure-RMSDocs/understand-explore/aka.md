# Azure Information Protection - also known as ...

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection, Office 365*

Azure Information Protection has evolved from a long history of Microsoft technologies that implement rights management protection. Because of this evolution, you might know this solution by one of its previous names. Or you might see references to these names in documentation, the UI, and log files. These previous names include the following:

As a cloud-based solution:

- **Azure Rights Management** or **Azure Rights Management service** - frequently abbreviated to **Azure RMS**.

- **Azure Active Directory Rights Management** - occasionally abbreviated to **AADRM**.

- **Windows Azure Active Directory Rights Management** - often abbreviated to **Windows Azure AD Rights Management**.

As an on-premises solution:

- **Active Directory Rights Management Services** - frequently abbreviated to **AD RMS**.

- **Windows Rights Management Services**  - often abbreviated to **Windows RMS*).

Other names include:

- **Microsoft Rights Management**, or **Microsoft Rights Management services**, which is a collective term that includes the current on-premises version (AD RMS) and the cloud-based version (Azure RMS).

- "**The NEW Microsoft RMS**", which was a popular label that was sometimes used when the cloud-based version was officially released, to emphasize the new ease of deployment in comparison to its on-premises predecessors.

- **Information Rights Management**, often abbreviated to **IRM**, which is the Office implementation of Rights Management that supports the current on-premises version (AD RMS) and the cloud-based version (Azure RMS). 

- **Rights Management Online** or **RMS Online**, which was a proposed early name for the cloud-based version of AD RMS. You might see this name in log files.

> [!TIP]
> You'll find many of these product and service names, and their related terms in [Terminology for Azure Rights Management](../get-started/terminology.md).

Note that as an enterprise information protection solution, these technologies have never provided digital rights management (DRM) solutions that typically protect against illegal distribution of digital software. 

## So does "Azure Information Protection" now replace all these names?

As the cloud-based solution that you purchase, yes. Azure Information Protection offers the new capabilities of classification and labeling for an organization's documents and emails, which in turn can apply Rights Management protection. 

However, Azure Rights Management is still used as the protection technology for Azure Information Protection, and for Office 365 services that use this cloud-based Rights Management protection. So in the context of the protection technology that is used by Azure Information Protection, "Azure Rights Management" (Azure RMS) remains a current name. 
Similarly, Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) remains a current name for the Windows Server server role, which provides on-premises Rights Management protection. This protection technology can be used with Azure Information Protection and might be suitable for a very small percentage of documents and emails that must be protected by an on-premises key. In this scenario, AD RMS is often referred to as the "hold your own key" or HYOK solution.
