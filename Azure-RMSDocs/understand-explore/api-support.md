# Other applications that support the RMS APIs

>*Applies to: Azure Rights Management, Office 365*

Use the following information to help you understand how Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS) can support other applications to protect your organizationâ€™s data.

By using the RMS SDK, your internal developers can write line-of-business applications to natively support [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../includes/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)]. How information protection is integrated with these applications depends on how they are written. For example, the integration might be automatically applied with minimal user interaction required, or for a more customized experience, users might be prompted to configure settings to apply information protection to files. For more information about the SDK, see the [Developer's Guide](../develop/developers-guide.md).

Similarly, many software vendors provide applications to provide  information protection solutions, also known as enterprise rights management (ERM) products. A popular example is a PDF reader that supports [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_2](../includes/aad_rightsmanagement_2_md.md)] for specific platforms. You can use the table in [Azure RMS requirements: Applications](../get-started/requirements-applications.md) to identify applications that support RMS (RMS-enlightened applications), and then use a web search to purchase or download the application.
