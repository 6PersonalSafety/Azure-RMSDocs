# What is Azure Information Protection?

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection*

Azure Information Protection helps you classify and label your documents and emails, which can be done automatically by administrators who define rules and conditions, manually by users, or a combination where users are given recommendations. For your most sensitive data, you can then protect it from unauthorized access, and control how this information is used.

When you classify your documents and emails, persistent labels are added to the data, so that the classification is identifiable at all times, regardless of where the data is stored or with whom it’s shared. The persistent labels include visual markings such as a header, footer, or watermark. 

Azure Rights Management is used for the protection. This technology is integrated with other Microsoft cloud services and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure Active Directory. It can also be used with your own line-of-business applications and information protection solutions from software vendors, whether these applications and solutions are on-premises, or in the cloud.

This protection technology uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies. Similarly to the persistent labels, protection that is applied by using Rights Management stays with the documents and emails, independently of the location—inside or outside your organization, networks, file servers, and applications. This information protection solution keeps you in control of your data, even when it is shared with other people.

For example, you can configure a report document or sales forecast spreadsheet so that it can be accessed only by people in your organization, and control whether that document can be edited, or restricted to read-only, or prevent it from being printed. You can configure emails similarly, and in addition, prevent them from being forwarded or prevent the use of the Reply All option. These protection tasks can be simplified and streamlined by using policy templates.

These templates can be part of a label's configuration, so that when a specific label is applied to a document (or email message), the data is both classified and automatically protected. The templates can also be selected by users or administrators in products and services that support the Azure Rights Management technology.

Azure Information Protection integrates with end user's existing workflows when the Azure Information Protection client is installed. This client installs an Information Protection bar to Office applications, making it easy for end users to select labels for the correct classification, and where necessary, protect their documents and emails.
