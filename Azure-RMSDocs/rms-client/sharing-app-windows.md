# Rights Management Sharing Application for Windows
The Rights Management sharing application for Windows (also known as just “the RMS sharing app”) is a free, downloadable application for organizations that use [Active Directory Rights Management Services](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc772403.aspx) (AD RMS) or [Azure Rights Management](../understand-explore/azure-rights-management.md) (Azure RMS), and for organizations that don’t have their own information protection infrastructure but want to consume content that has been protected by other organizations that use Azure RMS.
