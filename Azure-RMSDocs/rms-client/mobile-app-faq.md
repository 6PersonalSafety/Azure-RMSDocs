# FAQ for Microsoft Azure Information Protection app (preview) for iOS and Android

*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, Azure Rights Management*

This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android, currently in preview.

## What can I do with the Azure Information Protection app?

This app lets you open protected emails (.RPMSG files). This app also lets you open RMS-protected PDF files, pictures, text files, and any other file format that is protected as a .pfile.

## Can I open PDF files that are in SharePoint protected libraries and OneDrive For Business?

Yes, on iOS devices, you can open protected PDF files that others have shared with you via SharePoint and OneDrive for Business. Tap the link, and this app opens the file for you. We are working on enabling this capability for Android devices and will update this entry when it’s available.

## How do I sign in to this app?

If your organization already has AD RMS on-premises (with the mobile device extension) or Azure RMS, you can use your credentials to sign in. If not, you can sign up for a free new account at http://portal.aadrm.com.

## Can I sign up with my personal email address, such as a Hotmail or Gmail account?

Not yet. Today, you can sign up only with your business email address (work or school account). We’re working on support for personal email addresses and will update this entry when it’s available.

## Which file extensions can I open with this app?

You can open .pdf, .ppdf, .pjpg, .ptxt, and several other text and image file formats.

## Why do I have to consent before viewing a protected .pfile?

Consent is required to validate that you are aware of the following:

- The owner of the document expects you to honor the rights.

- Opening this content in a third-party application will be audited.

##  How do I provide feedback about this app?

In the app, tap the menu > **Settings** > **send feedback**.


## My question has not been answered—what should I do?
