# FAQs for Microsoft Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android

*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, Azure Information Protection*

This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about the Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android.

## What can I do with the Azure Information Protection app?

This app lets you view rights-protected email messages (.rpmsg files) if your email app doesn't natively support rights management data protection. This app also lets you view rights-protected PDF files, and pictures and text files that are rights-protected. Currently, you cannot use this app to create new protected email messages, reply to them, or create or edit protected files.

## Can I open PDF files that are in SharePoint protected libraries and OneDrive For Business?

Yes, you can open protected PDF files that others have shared with you via SharePoint and OneDrive for Business. Tap the link, and choose this app to open the file for you. 

## Can my mobile device run the Azure Information Protection app?

The Azure Information Protection app requires a minimum version of **iOS 8** or **Android 4.0.3**.

If you have these versions or higher, you can install the app to run on your mobile device:

- If your mobile device is managed by Microsoft Intune, you might be able to install the Azure Information Protection app from your company portal.

- If your mobile device is not managed by Microsoft Intune or the app isn't available from your company portal, you can install it either directly from the iTunes store and the Google Play store, or by clicking the iOS or Android icon from the **Mobile Devices** section on the [Azure Information Protection download page](https://portal.azurerms.com/#/download). 

## How do I get started with the viewer app?

After you've installed the app, you don't need to do anything more at that point. Wait until you get a protected email or file that you want to view, and then choose the **AIP Viewer** to open it. You will then be asked to sign in with your work or school account. After your credentials are authenticated, you can then read the contents.

However, if you don't want to wait, you can use the following instructions to send yourself a protected email or file to view: [Get started with the Microsoft Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android](mobile-app-get-started.md) 
## What credentials should I use to sign in to this app?

If your organization already has AD RMS on-premises (with the mobile device extension) or uses the Azure Rights Management service, you can use your credentials to sign in. If not, you can sign up for a free new account by using the [Azure Information Protection page](https://portal.office.com/signup?sku=rms&ru=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.azurerms.com%2F%23%2Fdownload).

## Can I sign up for the free account with my personal email address, such as a Hotmail or Gmail account?

Not yet. Today, you can sign up only with your business email address (work or school account). We’re working on support for personal email addresses and will update this entry when it’s available.

## Which file extensions can I open with this app?

You can open .rpmsg, .pdf, .ppdf, .pjpg, .ptxt, and several other text and image file formats.

##  How do I provide feedback about this app?

In the app, go to **Settings** > **Send feedback**.


## My question has not been answered—what should I do?
