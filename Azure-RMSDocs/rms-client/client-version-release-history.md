# Azure Information Protection client: Version release history

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection*

The Azure Information Protection team regularly updates the Azure Information Protection client for fixes and new functionality. The client is included in the Microsoft Update Catalog (category: **Azure Information Protection**) and you can always download the latest version from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53018).

Use the following information to see whatâ€™s new or changed in a release. The most current release is listed first. Versions before General Availability are not listed.

> [!NOTE]
> Minor fixes are not listed so if you experience a problem with the Azure Information Protection client, first check that it is not a problem with the latest release.
>  
> If the problem remains, open an Office application and on the **Home** tab, in the **Protection** group, click **Protect**, and then click **Help and feedback**. Click the **Send feedback** link, which you can use to automatically attach your client logs to an email message that can be sent to the Information Protection team to investigate. For support options, see the [Support options and community resources](../get-started/information-support.md#support-options-and-community-resources) information.

## Version 1.x.x.x

**Released**: 02/06/2017

**Fixes**:

- On Office 2010 Standard (which doesn't support protecting documents and emails): Labels that are configured to apply protection display as unavailable to users on the Azure Information Protection bar. Previously, these labels would display as available and then show an error message when selected by a user.

**New features**:

- A new, unified client that combines the features from the Rights Management sharing application for Windows with the Azure Information Protection client. Includes:
    
    - Integration with Windows File Explorer (right-click) to apply labels and protection. Supports additional file formats and multiple file selection.
    - A viewer for protected documents (includes protected PDF for SharePoint).
    - PowerShell cmdlets to get and set labels for files that are stored locally or on network shares. These cmdlets install with the cmdlets that previously shipped with the RMS Protection Tool (RMSProtection module).

This client version is the General Availability release of the preview client that was [announced in December 2016](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2016/12/07/azure-information-protection-december-preview-now-available/). For more information, which includes updates since the preview, see the following admin and user guides:

- [Azure Information Protection client administrator guide](client-admin-guide.md)

- [Azure Information Protection user guide](client-user-guide.md)


## Version 1.2.4.0

**Released**: 10/27/2016

**Fixes**:

- Client installation completes when the Windows Update service is disabled.

- In Office 2016, when you save a document and an applied label is configured for a header or footer, the cursor does not jump to the header or footer.

- Automatic classification works in Word for text in bundled text boxes.

**New feature**:

- Diagnostic tests and a reset option that a user can run from the Office application when the Azure Information Protection client is installed: On the **Home** tab, in the **Protection** group, click **Protect**, click **Help and feedback**, and then click **Run diagnostics**. 

    For more information about this option, see the [To verify installation, connection status, or report a problem](client-admin-guide.md#to-verify-installation-connection-status-or-report-a-problem) section from the client installation documentation.

## Version 1.1.23.0
