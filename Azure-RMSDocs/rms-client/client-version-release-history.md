## Version 1.3.155.2

**Released**: 02/08/2017

**New requirements**:

Microsoft .NET Framework

- This version of the Azure Information Protection client requires a minimum version of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 and if this is missing, the installer tries to download and install it. A computer restart might be required after the Azure Information Protection client installation is complete.

- If the Azure Information Protection Viewer is installed separately, this requires a minimum version of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 and if this is missing, the installer does not download or install it.

**New features**:

- A new, unified client that combines the features from the Rights Management sharing application for Windows with the Azure Information Protection client. Includes:
    
    - Integration with Windows File Explorer (right-click) to apply labels and protection. Supports additional file formats and multiple file selection.
    - A viewer for protected documents (includes protected PDF for SharePoint).
    - PowerShell cmdlets to get and set labels for files that are stored locally or on network shares. These cmdlets install with the cmdlets that previously shipped with the RMS Protection Tool (RMSProtection module).
    - Client usage logs that record information such as which label was applied, how, and by whom.

This client version is the [General Availability release](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/02/08/azure-information-protection-december-update-moves-to-general-availability/) of the preview client that was first announced in December 2016. For more information about this version of the client, see the following guides:

- [Azure Information Protection client administrator guide](client-admin-guide.md)

- [Azure Information Protection user guide](client-user-guide.md)


## Version 1.2.4.0

**Released**: 10/27/2016

**Fixes**:

- Client installation completes when the Windows Update service is disabled.

- In Office 2016, when you save a document and an applied label is configured for a header or footer, the cursor does not jump to the header or footer.

- Automatic classification works in Word for text in bundled text boxes.

**New feature**:

- Diagnostic tests and a reset option that a user can run from the Office application when the Azure Information Protection client is installed: On the **Home** tab, in the **Protection** group, click **Protect**, click **Help and feedback**, and then click **Run diagnostics**. 

    For more information about this option, see the [To verify installation, connection status, or send feedback](client-admin-guide.md#to-verify-installation-connection-status-or-send-feedback) section from the client installation documentation.

## Version 1.1.23.0

**Released**: 10/01/2016
