# Download and install the Azure Information Protection client

>*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, Azure Information Protection, Windows 10, Windows 7 with SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1*

**[ This version of the client is in preview and subject to change. ]**

If your administrator does not install the Azure Information Protection client for you, you can do this yourself if you are a local administrator on your PC.

## To download and install the Azure Information Protection client

1.  Go to the [Microsoft Download Site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53018) and download the **preview** version of the Azure Information Protection client.

2. Double-click the executable file that was downloaded. 

3. On the **Install the Azure Information Protection client** page: 
    
    - Select the option to install a demo policy if you cannot connect to the cloud but want to see and experience the client side of Azure Information Protection by using a local policy for demonstration purposes. When your client connects to an Azure Information Protection service, this demo policy is replaced with your organization's Azure Information Protection policy.
    
    - Click **I agree** when you have read the license terms and conditions.

4. If you are prompted to continue, click **Yes**, and wait for the installation to finish.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Windows 7 SP1, the Azure Information Protection client requires a specific update [KB 2533623](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2533623). Setup checks to see whether this is installed and if it is not, you will see a message to install it.

3. Click **Close** and before you start to use the Azure Information Protection client:

    - If your computer runs Office 2010, restart your computer.
    
    - For other versions of Office, restart all Office applications.
