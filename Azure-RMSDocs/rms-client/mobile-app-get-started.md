# Get started with the Microsoft Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android

*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, Azure Information Protection*

Most users will typically use the Azure Information Protection app automatically when they need to open a protected email or file. But if you are an admin who wants to test the app for your users, or simply want to try it out before you need it, you can use the following instructions.

From your mobile device, you will need to access one of the files that the app supports to see the viewer in action. For example:

- **A .rpmsg file**: This is a rights-protected email message that displays as an attachment in an email message when your email app on your mobile device does not natively support rights management data protection. 
    
    Use another device to send yourself a rights-protected email message that you can access from your mobile device. For example, use Outlook from a Windows computer. For a list of email clients that natively support rights management, see the EMAIL column from the [Applications that support Azure Rights Management data protection](../get-started/requirements-applications.md) page.

- **A rights-protected PDF file**: Use the Rights Management sharing application from a Windows computer or a PDF application that natively supports rights management to send yourself a rights-protected PDF file as an attachment in email. Alternatively, upload a PDF file to a SharePoint protected library and then share it, using your email address.

- **A .ptxt or .pjpg or .ppng**: Use the Rights Management sharing application from a Windows computer and the [Share Protected](sharing-app-protect-by-email.md) option to send yourself a protected file as an email attachment. For the full list of file types that you can use for testing, see the first table from the [Supported file types and file name extensions](sharing-app-admin-guide-technical.md#supported-file-types-and-file-name-extensions) section in the Rights Management sharing application admin guide. 

To view these files in the Azure Information Protection viewer app, tap the email attachment or link. When you're prompted to select an app to open them with, select the **AIP Viewer** app. You'll then be prompted to sign in for your work or school account. After you're successfully authenticated, the Azure Information Protection app displays the email or file for you to read.
