# Tasks that you used to do with the RMS sharing application

Recently upgraded from the Rights Management sharing application (also known as just the "RMS sharing app") to the Azure Information Protection client? 

Use the following information to help you get up and running quickly.

|The RMS sharing app|How to do this with the Azure Information Protection client
|-----------|--------------------|
|Protect a file on a device <br /><br />Also known as "protect in place"|For Office apps that display the Azure Information Protection bar: Select a label that applies the required protection.<br /><br />For other files, and if the Azure Information Protection client is in [protection-only mode](client-protection-only-mode.md): Use the File Explorer menu option, **Classify and protect** to open the **Classify and protect - Azure Information Protection** dialog box. Then select a label that applies the required protection, or specify your own custom permissions. <br /><br />For more information, see [Classify and protect a file or email](client-classify-protect.md).
|Protect a file that you share by email <br /><br />Also known as "share protected"|If you are sharing internally: Apply a label with the required protection to your document or email message, or select the Outlook **Do Not Forward** option. <br /><br /> If you are sharing externally: Using a copy of the file, use File Explorer to protect the file with custom permissions. Then share the file using your standard sharing mechanism, such as an attachment to an email or an invitation to a SharePoint Online document. Consider including the https://aka.ms/rms-signup link as instructions for first-time use. <br /><br />For more information about sharing externally, see the [Safely share a file with people outside your organization](client-classify-protect.md#safely-share-a-file-with-people-outside-your-organization) section from the user guide.
|Change permissions on protected files <br /><br />Also known as "re-protect"|For Office apps that display the Azure Information Protection bar: Select a label that applies the required protection.<br /><br />For other files, and if the Azure Information Protection client is in [protection-only mode](client-protection-only-mode.md): Use the File Explorer menu option, **Classify and protect** to open the **Classify and protect - Azure Information Protection** dialog box. Then select a label that applies the required protection, or specify your own custom permissions.<br /><br />For more information, see [Classify and protect a file or email](client-classify-protect.md).
|Track and revoke documents|For Office apps: Open the document and then, on the **Home** tab > **Protection** group > **Protect** > **Track and revoke**<br /><br />From File Explorer: Right click a file or folder > **Classify and protect**. Then in the **Classify and protect - Azure Information Protection** dialog box, click **Track and revoke**. <br /><br />For more information, see [Track and revoke your documents](client-track-revoke.md).
|View and use files that have been protected|The Azure Information Protection Viewer can open protected files so that you can read them, and also print and save these files if you have permissions to do these actions. This viewer is automatically installed with the client, or you can install it separately.<br /><br />For more information, see [Open files that have been protected](client-view-use-files.md).
|Remove protection from files|Use the File Explorer menu option, **Classify and protect** to open the **Classify and protect - Azure Information Protection** dialog box. <br /><br />Then, for a single file, clear the **Protect with custom permissions** option. For multiple files or a folder, click **Remove custom permissions**.<br /><br />For more information, see [Remove labels and protection from files and emails](client-remove-label-protection.md).|

## Can't find the option you're looking for?

If you're looking for a specific option that you're used to selecting with the RMS sharing application, check the following table.

|Option in the RMS sharing app|Information
|-----------|--------------------|
|**Share Protected**|This option is no longer available from the Office ribbon. Instead of sharing directly from within your Office application, use File Explorer's right-click option, **Classify and protect** to protect a copy of the document with custom permissions, and then share the file using your choice of email client, or sharing location. Consider including the https://aka.ms/rms-signup link as instructions for first-time use. <br /><br />For more information about sharing externally, see the [Safely share a file with people outside your organization](#safely-share-a-file-with-people-outside-your-organization) section from the user guide.
|**Email me when somebody tries to open these documents**|Use the document tracking site to configure your preferred email notification setting: Locate the protected document that you shared > **Settings** > **Email notifications**
|**Allow me to instantly revoke access to these documents**|This option is no longer available. Configure templates that do not allow offline access. Additionally, consider whether you need to reduce the use license validity period for your tenant, by running [Set-AadrmMaxUseLicenseValidityTime](/powershell/aadrm/vlatest/set-aadrmmaxuselicensevaliditytime).
